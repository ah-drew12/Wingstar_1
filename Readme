This repository contains solution for test tasks for the joining to the Data Science internship.
There are two tasks which solution is separated in 2 folders. In each folder you can find scripts and jupyter notebook file with description of the solution and the result.

Task 1. Image classification + OOP
In this task, you need to use a publicly available simple MNIST dataset and build 3 classification models around it. It should be the following models:

Random Forest;
Feed-Forward Neural Network;
Convolutional Neural Network;

Each model should be a separate class that implements MnistClassifierInterface with 2 abstract methods - train and predict. Finally, each of your three models should be hidden under another MnistClassifier class. MnistClassifer takes an algorithm as an input parameter. Possible values for the algorithm are: cnn, rf, and nn for the three models described above.


Task 2. Named entity recognition + image classification
In this task, you will work on building your ML pipeline that consists of 2 models responsible for totally different tasks. The main goal is to understand what the user is asking (NLP) and check if he is correct or not (Computer Vision).

You will need to:

1.find or collect an animal classification/detection dataset that contains at least 10 classes of animals.
2.train NER model for extracting animal titles from the text. Please use some transformer-based model (not LLM).
3.Train the animal classification model on your dataset.
4.Build a pipeline that takes as inputs the text message and the image.
